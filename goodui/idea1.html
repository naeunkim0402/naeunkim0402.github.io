    <p class=text>A one column layout will give you more control over your narrative. <br>
        It should be able to guide your readers in a more predictable way from <br>
        top to bottom. Whereas a multi column approach runs some additional risk<br>
        of being distracting to the core purpose of a page. <br>
        Guide people with a story and a prominent call to action at the end.<br>
        Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere, <br>
        for the sky was a dead black, and the stars had ceased to twinkle.<br>
        By the same illusion which lifts the horizon of the sea to the level <br>
        of the spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out, <br>
        and the car seemed to float in the middle of an immense dark sphere, <br>
        whose upper half was strewn with silver. Looking down into the dark<br>
        gulf below,I could see a ruddy light streaming through a rift in the clouds.<br>
