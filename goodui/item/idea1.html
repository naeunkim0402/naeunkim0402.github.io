    <div class=text>A one column layout will give you more control 
        over your narrative. <br>It should be able to guide your readers <br> 
        in a more predictable way from top to bottom. Whereas a  <br>
        multi column approach runs some additional risk<br>
        of being distracting to the core purpose of a page. <br>
        Guide people with a story and a prominent call to action at the end.<br>
        Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere, <br>
        for the sky was a dead black, and the stars had ceased to twinkle.<br>
